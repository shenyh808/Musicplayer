# MusicPlayer

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/MusicPlayer`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

I have created a Musicplayer with multiple playlist for all music lovers. Playlist that can uplifting, get you in your feels, heal, and most importantly... get you dancing like no one is watching.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'MusicPlayer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install MusicPlayer

## Usage
Launching this program is easy, first step to get this going is to get clone this. How? https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository This would provide clear guidelines on how to do so. Once you do that, you will need to get an API from Spotify. https://www.spotify.com/us/ In order to do so, you would have to log in, go into the dashboard where there will be a client ID. 

TODO: Write usage instructions here
git clone down to ./bin/start 

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
